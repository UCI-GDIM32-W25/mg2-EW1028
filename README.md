# HW2
## Devlog

In the MG2 break down activity, I planned the game by sparating responsibilities between the Player, Coin, and GameController objects, and that structure directly guided how I wrote my code and set up my Unity. Based on my plan, the Player GameObject is responsible for jumping. In the Unity, the player has a Rigidbody2D, Collider2D, and player script. In the code, jumping is handled by checking whether the player is grounded before applying an upwardforce when the space key is pressed. This directly matches my original plan that the player should only be able to jump when touching the ground. The Coin GameObject follows the design from the plan by containing a SpriteRender, Collider2D, set as a trigger, and its own movement behavior. Coins move across the screen and are removed once they leave the visiable area, which matches the idea in my plan that coins spawn, move, and despawn continuosly to make the game infinitely playable. The GameCOntroller GameObject connects everything together, just like in my break down diagram. In my plan, the GameController was responsible for tracking points variable, UpdatePoints() method, and continously spawns coins usinga coroutine SpawnCoin() with randomized time intervals. This directly implements the requirement that coins appear at not perfectly regular intervals. When the player collides with a coin, the collison logic follows the original plan exacctly. The coin detects the collision with the player, calls the GameController to increase the score, updates the UI, and then requirements that collecting a coin both increases the socre and remove the coin from the sence. Overal, the MG2 break down activity served as a clear bluprint for both y code and sence setup. Each major part of the plan maps directly to a Gameobject, script, and method in the final implementation. While coding, I did not meed to significantly change the plan, becasue the original structure of the plan already clearly defined how the Play, Coin, and GameController should interact.
